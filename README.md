### Summary

Think of a green apple.

Now think of a fluffy kitten.

As you were imagining these, you might have noticed that you have internal ‘representations’ of various objects and concepts. Can we create an algorithm that has internal representations of handwritten digits and fashion items? We find that with a large amount of image data then k-means clustering’s centroids, when plotted, resemble the most common item assigned to the cluster and will be an identifiable representation of the datasets classes.
